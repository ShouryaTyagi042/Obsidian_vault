An application programming interface is a way for two or more computer programs to communicate with each other. It is a type of software interface, that offers a service to other pieces of software.

## Rest API
A REST API (also known as RESTful API) is an application programming interface (API or web API) that conforms to the constraints of REST architectural style and allows for interaction with RESTful web services. REST stands for representational state transfer and was created by computer scientist Roy Fielding.

A **RESTful API**, also known as **REST API**, is based on **Representational State Transfer (REST)**, which is an architectural style and communication approach commonly used in the development of Web Services.

A REST Server simply provides access to resources and REST client accesses and modifies the resources using HTTP protocol. Here each resource is identified by URIs/ global IDs. REST uses various representation to represent a resource like text, JSON, XML but JSON is the most popular one.
