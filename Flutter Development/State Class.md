State is information that (1) can be read synchronously when the widget is built and (2) might change during the lifetime of the widget. It is the responsibility of the widget implementer to ensure that the [State](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/State-class.html) is promptly notified when such state changes, using [State.setState](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/State/setState.html).
